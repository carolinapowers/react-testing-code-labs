          <h2>React Testing Library Best Practices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use <code>getbyRole()</code> if your component doesn't need to
              wait on anything to be loaded. Also, <code>getByRole()</code>{" "}
              throws helpful errors that you might not see with the other
              options.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use <code>queryByRole()</code> when testing some element that is
              not in the document as <code>queryByRole()</code> won't error if
              the element isn't found.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use await <code>findByRole()</code> when waiting for an element to
              be found, when possible.
            </li>

            <li>
              Use <code>@testing-library/user-event</code> over{" "}
              <code>fireEvent</code> when possible.
            </li>

            <li>
              Use <code>waitFor()</code> method to wait for your component to be
              rendered when mocking an API call and not testing any side effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use <code>screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()</code> or{" "}
              <code>screen.debug()</code> to check that your component is truly
              being rendered with{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Be aware that <code>logTestingPlaygroundURL()</code> might output
              an URL that doesn't render anything if your component is too big.
              Keeping your components small not also helps with the readability
              but it helps when debugging your tests.
            </li>
            <li>
              When using <code>screen.debug()</code>, the DOM tree returned by
              the function limits the number of characters to render and it
              might not show the entire component. If you need to check things
              out further in the tree you can use something like{" "}
              <code>screen.debug(undefined, 30000)</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do <strong>not</strong> use <code>act()</code> and{" "}
              <code>waitFor()</code> for the sake of getting rid of the{" "}
              <code>act()</code> warnings thrown by the library as the poor
              usage of both can cause false positives. Read more on when to use
              what in the resources below.
